# Data Structures and Cryptography Project üèóÔ∏è

## Overview
This project integrates data structures and recursion techniques to create a versatile application. It offers functionalities in cryptography, duplicate word detection in sentences using circular linked lists, and word reversal in sentences employing both recursion and linked lists.

### Program Workflow:
1. **Initial Options:** Upon launching, the program presents several options to the user:
    1. Cryptography
    2. Duplicate Word Detection
    3. Word Reversal Using Recursion
    4. Exit

2. **Cryptography Features:** Selecting the 'Cryptography' option leads to further choices:
    1. **Encoding:** User inputs a string for encryption. The encryption is based on an alphabet-shift algorithm, determined by a user-provided numeric key.
    2. **Decoding:** User inputs a string for decryption, reversing the encryption process.
    3. **Exit to Main Menu**
    *Note: Encryption and decryption shift characters based on the alphabet, according to the user's numerical input.*

3. **Duplicate Word Detection:** This feature analyzes a user-entered sentence to identify duplicate words using a circular linked list. For example:
    * Input: "alex eats apple does that mean she likes apple?"
    * Output: "Duplicate word detected" or "No duplicate words" based on the analysis.

4. **Word Reversal Using Recursion:** This option allows users to reverse the order of words in a sentence. The process utilizes recursion and a singly linked list. For instance:
    * Input: "alex eats apple"
    * Output: "apple eats alex"

5. **Navigation and Exit:** Selecting 'Exit' in any submenu returns the user to the main menu. Choosing 'Exit' from the main menu terminates the program.

## Purpose
The primary aim of this program is to provide a hands-on experience in applying data structures, specifically arrays and various forms of linked lists, in practical scenarios. It serves as a small-scale project illustrating the real-world applications of these data structures, along with recursion, enhancing the understanding and skills gained in a data structure course.
